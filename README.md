minus eight times x plus two times t equal to six and minus ten times x minus five times t equal to seven


##Usage
#1. Clone the repositories
 $ git clone https://github.com/pdollar/coco.git

#2. Generate LaTex corresponds to each type of equations and its textual descriptions
$ pip install -r requirement.txt
$ cd 0_code_generate_latex_equation
$ python 1_pair_of_equation.py 
(Generate LaTex for pair of equations and their textual descriptions; saved in 1_generate_latex_files/1_pair_of_equation_latex and 20_generate_textual_description/
